**Version 1.0**  
**Date:** May 3, 2025  
**Authors:** \[Placeholder for Author(s)\]

## **1\. Executive Summary**

This report outlines the core concept and functional specifications for a novel system design diagramming tool, code-named "Layerboard." The primary objective is to provide a dynamic, navigable environment for visualizing and managing complex system architectures across multiple levels of abstraction. Unlike traditional flat-canvas diagramming tools, Layerboard natively supports hierarchical decomposition, allowing users to define system components and processes at high levels and seamlessly explore their internal details by expanding nodes into lower-level diagrams.

## **2\. Problem Statement**

Current widely-used diagramming tools for system design (e.g., Lucidchart, draw.io, Visio) treat diagrams as static, flat canvases. Representing complex system architectures often requires maintaining multiple separate diagrams at different abstraction levels (e.g., a high-level system overview, separate diagrams for individual services or modules). This approach leads to several critical issues:

* **Complexity Management:** Difficult to grasp the entirety of a complex system and its intricate relationships across various levels.  
* **Disconnection Between Levels:** Lack of inherent links between diagrams representing different abstraction levels, making it hard to trace dependencies or understand how high-level components map to lower-level implementations.  
* **Maintenance Overhead:** Significant manual effort required to keep separate diagrams consistent as the system evolves, particularly regarding connections that span abstraction layers.  
* **Limited Support for Iterative Design:** The tools do not naturally facilitate the process of starting with abstract concepts and progressively adding detail.

## **3\. Solution Overview**

Layerboard addresses these problems by modeling system architecture as a directed graph where nodes are inherently expandable and can contain nested graphs representing lower levels of detail. The system supports navigation (conceptual "zooming" or "drilling down") into these nested graphs, maintaining the context of the parent level and specifically managing connections that cross abstraction boundaries. This allows users to design iteratively, starting broad and defining details only as needed, within a unified, navigable structure. The core innovation lies in the seamless visual transition between abstraction levels and the explicit management of connections that span these levels.

## **4\. User Stories**

To illustrate the core functionality from a user's perspective, consider the following key user stories:

* **Story 1: Top-Down Design Initiation**  
  * As a system architect, I want to start by creating a high-level diagram showing the major external systems and users interacting with my system (System Context) so that I can define the overall scope and external interfaces.  
* **Story 2: Decomposing a System Component**  
  * As a system architect, I want to take a node representing a major subsystem or service and expand it to design its internal structure (e.g., showing its constituent applications, data stores, or internal modules) so that I can manage its complexity and delegate detailed design.  
* **Story 3: Detailing Internal Processing Logic**  
  * As a lead engineer, I want to take a component node responsible for a specific function (e.g., an API handler) and expand it to diagram the sequence of operations and data flow within that function so that I can clearly specify the implementation logic.  
* **Story 4: Navigating Design Details**  
  * As a new team member, I want to click on a service in the high-level diagram and seamlessly drill down through its internal modules to understand how a specific feature is implemented within that service's code boundaries.  
* **Story 5: Tracing Cross-Level Connections**  
  * As a debugging engineer, I want to see which specific internal component(s) within a service are receiving requests from an external system (as defined at a higher level) so that I can understand the entry point for that interaction.  
* **Story 6: Maintaining Consistency During Expansion**  
  * As a system designer, when I expand a node, I want the tool to clearly show the connections that were coming into or going out of that node at the higher level and allow me to easily map them to the appropriate nodes within the expanded diagram, helping me ensure the interfaces are correctly represented across levels.

## **5\. Technical Specifications (Functional)**

The core Layerboard system shall provide the following functional capabilities:

* **Graph Definition:** Ability to define directed graphs composed of nodes and edges. Graphs serve as containers for diagram elements at a specific abstraction level. Each graph is a distinct visual canvas representing the contents of its parent node.  
* **Node Management:** Support for adding, removing, and editing nodes within any graph. Each node shall possess:  
  * A unique identifier within its graph.  
  * A user-editable name/label.  
  * A defined 'Type' (e.g., System, Container, Component, Operation, Person, External System) that dictates its semantic meaning and potential behavior.  
  * A flexible mechanism for storing arbitrary metadata (Properties).  
* **Edge Management:** Support for adding, removing, and editing directed edges between nodes *within the same graph*. Each edge shall possess:  
  * A unique identifier within its graph.  
  * References to its source and target nodes within that graph.  
  * A defined 'Type' (e.g., Uses API, Sends Message, Reads Data, Data Flow) describing the relationship.  
  * A flexible mechanism for storing arbitrary metadata (Properties).  
* **Hierarchical Linking (Expansion):** Ability to designate a node as 'expandable'. An expandable node shall be linked to exactly one child graph. This child graph represents the internal detail of the parent node. The UI shall visually indicate which nodes are expandable.  
* **Navigable Hierarchy:** The system shall provide a user interface that allows users to navigate from an expandable node in a parent graph into its associated child graph (e.g., via double-click or an explicit "Expand" action), and to navigate back up from a child graph to its parent context (e.g., via a "Back" button or breadcrumbs).  
* **Cross-Level Connection Management:** This is critical for maintaining design integrity across levels. The system must:  
  * Store definitions of how edges connecting *to* or *from* an expandable node in a parent graph are conceptually linked to one or more specific nodes *within* its child graph.  
  * When viewing the child graph, visually represent these incoming/outgoing connections from the parent level. This might be via indicators on the boundary of the child graph's canvas or visual cues linking back to the parent context.  
  * Provide user interface mechanisms for users to define and edit these mappings (i.e., specifying which internal node(s) handle which external connection). This ensures that the internal design correctly accounts for the external interfaces defined at the higher level.  
* **Multi-Type Interpretation:** The system shall interpret different graphs or sections of the hierarchy as representing different conceptual diagram types (e.g., a graph linked from a 'System' node might be interpreted as a Container diagram; a graph linked from a 'Component' node might be interpreted as a Dataflow diagram), potentially influencing default layout behavior, allowed edge types, or visual styling within that specific graph view.

## **6\. Technical Specifications (Data Model \- Conceptual)**

The underlying data model must support a recursive, tree-like structure where each node can potentially be the root of another graph.

* There will be a top-level container for the entire system model, holding a collection of all graphs defined within the project.  
* Each Graph object conceptually represents a single diagram canvas at a specific level of abstraction. It contains a collection of Node objects and a collection of Edge objects that exist *within* that specific diagram view.  
* Each Node object represents a discrete element on a graph canvas. It holds properties like its name, type, and metadata. Crucially, a Node can optionally hold a reference to the unique identifier of another Graph object. If this reference exists, this node is expandable, and the referenced graph represents its internal content.  
* Each Edge object represents a directed connection between two Node objects *within the same graph*. It holds references to its source and target node IDs, its type, and metadata.  
* To manage cross-level connections, the data model must store mapping information. This information is conceptually associated with the *expandable parent node*. It links the unique identifiers of edges in the *parent graph* (that connect to or from this node) to the unique identifiers of one or more nodes *within its child graph*. This mapping data is essential for the UI to correctly visualize and manage connections when navigating between parent and child graphs.

## **7\. Out of Scope**

This report focuses solely on the core hierarchical, expandable graph functionality. The following features, while desirable for the final product, are explicitly out of scope for this core definition:

* Automatic graph layout algorithms.  
* Polished visual rendering and export capabilities.  
* Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs).  
* Real-time multi-user collaboration.  
* Detailed version control beyond basic saving.  
* Specific drag-and-drop interactions or other granular UI element behaviors beyond the conceptual navigation and mapping described.
