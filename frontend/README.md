# Layerboard

## Intro

Layerboard is graphical, drag-and-drop diagramming app (similar to Lucid). Its main differentiator is that it embraces abstraction and lets you fill in the details as you go.

### Example User Stories

- As a software architect, I want to design complex systems from the top downâ€”starting from a high-level overview design and then drilling down into the details.
- As a software architect with experience designing using the C4 model, I want to begin by building a context diagram, where my whole system is represented as a single node, and then move onto the next level of detail where I specify the subsystems that exist within the system, and so on.
- As a software architect that doesn't like to be constrained by a specific model, I want to be able to "expand" on any node in my diagram and specify its constituent parts, regardless of whether they are software components, infrastructure components, or even business processes.
- As a fast-paced startup architect, I want to have an intuitive diagramming experience that doesn't need me to worry about how it looks
